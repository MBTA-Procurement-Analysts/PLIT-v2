Due to their high technical scores, Bidder disqualification at this time was not reasonable. Main Overhaul AR10-D14 Floats were also requested in the posted RFP due to the uncertainty of which LOCO's were to be 1st in line for required generator upgrade. Due to the gap in tech scoring between the 2 top tech scorers and rest of the bidders, a request was made to the 2 top scorers to answer if the \"no bid\" submission by both bidders for Main Overhaul AR10-CA5 floats was accurate. Sherwood responded with a corrected bid due to the recent ability to bid on Main Overhaul AR10-CA5 Float. Magnetech responded to our clarification request with \"no bid\" - with response \"At the current time, Magnetech does not have a CA 5 in our core pool. We could not supply the AR10-CA5.\"  It is unspoken but widely known that the Bidders have option to acquiring the unit and offer for resale to MBTA, should they choose. Nonetheless, a second \"no bid\" was issued by Magnetech. It was decided that Sherwood, in combination of their technical score and ability to provide the product would be considered the leading finalist.
